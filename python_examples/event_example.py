# About subscription flags:
#
# PS_FLAGS_LOCAL_NETSUB means that we subscribe also from the network,
# even if data already exists locally. Note, however, that the normal
# subscribe-calls anyway return a local version if one
# exists. Moreover, if somebody publishes something locally, the
# subscribe-call returns with local data regardless of any flags.
#
# PS_FLAGS_NET_PERSISTENT means that we subscribe to all future
# versions from the network, in addition to the latest one.
#
# Flags not used in this example:
#
# PS_FLAGS_LOCAL_FUTUREONLY means that a synchronous subscribe call
# should not return a version that exists in the node-local blackboard
# at the time of subscribing. The meaning is the same in advance
# subscription registration, but in that case its probably better to
# self ignore any existing version(s) when needed.
#
# PS_FLAGS_NET_FUTUREONLY means that we do not want to get any current
# version that our local rendezvous node might know about.
# (XXX: What about our own local RZV instance?)
#
# PS_FLAGS_LOCAL_LOCALSUB means that we do not send out a subscription
# to the network. Somebody else (e.g., another app) might do that,
# though, so it doesn't prevent us from getting data that originates
# from some other node.
