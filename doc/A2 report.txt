Unhandled situations in implementation:

- escaping of content
- access control
- race conditions, eg. two browsers send the same reservation at once. who should win?


Something is wrong with my Subscriber code:

When I subscribe to a RID, I don't get its updates before the second update.
- When the first object is published, subscriber receives the Blackhawk's kevent, but it is a "None" object.
- When the second object is published, subscriber receives the first object and only after that the second object.

Event_example.py works correctly, but it is not helpful, because it does not
give an example of how to use handle_event() without global variables. At my
project work I would have needed to make the websocket a global variable,
which I did not want to do.

API does not support requesting a RID's content before entering the listen()
loop. If I just want the content before looping, the most practical way of achieving this seems to be a synchronous one-time subscription.

The init_handle_event() method feels like a hack because there is no example
of how to actually use the received publishment in the caller. The example of
doing a print() is not especially useful. API should support e.g. yielding the
response in order for the caller to implement the handling code. Then we would
not need handle_event() at all.

API is confusing at times
 instead of having both
   PubSubKQueue#register_advance_subscription
 and 
   PubSubKQueue#reg_adv_sub_s
it would probably be more consistent to have only one method and allow a parameter to define the format of sid&rid.

Blackhawk crashes the whole FreeBSD on average once per hour. See doc/crash_imgs for details.
