USAGE
=====

1) Ensure that nobody else than you have access to your virtual machine's ip.
2) Start web server as root (root is required for Blackhawk access):
   % ./start_server.sh
3) Configure your virtual machine ip to the HTML file you are testing, e.g.
   var wsAddress = "ws://192.168.2.3:80/subscriber";
   in file public/subscriber.html
4) Direct your web browser to e.g. http://192.168.2.3/subscriber.html
   You may open several windows to see pubsub in action.
5) Publish data with
   % ./main_publisher.py

--> You should see updates in the browser.
