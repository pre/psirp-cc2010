- escaping of content

- race conditions, eg. two browsers send the same reservation at once. who should win?


Something is wrong with advance subscriptions..
If I publish to a rid which does not yet have content, I don't receive the publishment before something is published again.
Event_example.py works, but it is does not help, because it does not give an example of how to use handle_event() without global variables. At my project work I would have needed to make the websocket a global variable.

API is confusing at times
 instead of having both
   PubSubKQueue#register_advance_subscription
 and 
   PubSubKQueue#reg_adv_sub_s
it would probably be more consistent to have only one method and allow a parameter to define the format of sid&rid.


Blackhawk crashes the whole FreeBSD very often. The cause might also be the Python webserver, but the system has crashed also without it.
