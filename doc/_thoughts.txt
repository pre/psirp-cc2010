PSIRP-methods should be queried from a scoped namespace, 
now functions such as create() and sub_s() are in global namespace.

How to grow slice length when republishing?
- should we create() a new publishment?

Something goes wrong with the VirtualBox, it eats constantly 100% of allocated processor time and memory.
That happens although FreeBSD does not seem to consume that much.

PSIRP-API is could be "more" object oriented
Why the programmer has to take care of publishment's length? 
Why not to provide a object constructor which could calculate the length and 
Why create in global namespace instead of a class method? 
Why not to provide event-listener as a built-in method in API? 
 - now I just copy-pasted event_example.py to its own module because I did not want to reinvent the wheel

If sid and rid are strings, the following method fails silently and does not. 
It should raise an exception and tell that parameters were incorrect.
Parameters can only be atoid(sid) and atoid(rid).
- FAILS: PubSubKQueue().register_advance_subscription("::aa", "::bb", [..])

Why buffer length has to be fixed? Why can't PSIRP adjust it dynamically? 
- taking care of a buffer length in Python feels very low level
  p = Publishment("_OLD_CONTENT_OLD_CONTENT_OLD_CONTENT_OLD_CONTENT_OLD_CONTENT")
  p.publish("::aa","::bb")
  p.update_content("_new_content_new_content")

Could there be a "replace"-function in the API which would replace old published content with new content without having to deal with buffer lengths?
